                <dt><b>American Bullfrog</b></dt> <dd><i>Lithobates catesbeianus</i><br />
                The American bullfrog can range from a dark solid olive to a pale green with spotting.<br />
                They can be found nearly everywhere in Wisconsin where there is a suitable habitat, like a lake with abuntant shoreline and aquatic vegetation.</dd>
                    <hr>
                <dt><b>American Toad</b></dt> <dd><i>Anaxyrus americanus</i><br />
                    While a toad, not a frog, it is still counted among Wisconsin's many frog species.<br />
                Easily identifiable by its dry, rough skin, the Amerian toad can be found in prairies, wetlands, and forests all across Wisconsin. </dd>
                    <hr>

                The frog is primarily located in habitats along rivers in southern Wisconsin, but is listed as Endangered due to habitat loss caused by agricultural pollution.</dd>
                    <hr>
                <dt><b>Boreal Chorus Frog</b></dt> <dd><i>Pseudacris maculata</i><br/>

                The frog is located in marshy habitats throughout most of Wisconsin, though is not common in northeastern Wisconsin.</dd>
                    <hr>
                <dt><b>Cope's Gray Treefrog</b></dt> <dd><i>Hyla chrysoscelis</i><br />
                Smaller and slighly smoother skinned than the gray treefrog, Cope's gray treefrog are a solid lime green during the non breeding season and gray during the breeding season.<br />
                The frog lives among the brush in forests in parts of western, central, and eastern Wisconsin.</dd>
                    <hr>
                <dt><b>Gray Treefrog</b></dt> <dd><i>Hyla versicolor</i><br />
                The gray treefrog's color can range between gray and green depending on temperature or the color of the surface they reside on, though unlike Cope's gray treefrog, they do not lose their molting when warm.<br />
                They dwell in forests and woodlands all throughout Wisconsin.</dd>
                    <hr>
                <dt><b>Green Frog</b></dt> <dd><i>Lithobates clamitans</i><br />
                Green frogs are a light to dark olive green or brown with small irregular dark brown spots.<br />
                The frogs are found all across Wisconsin in permanent water sources with adequate shorline vegetation such as lakes, large ponds, and deep marshes.</dd>
                    <hr>
                <dt><b>Mink Frog</b></dt> <dd><i>Lithobates septentrionalis</i><br />
                The mink frog is olive to brown in color with darker green or brown spots/molting on its back.<br />
                The frog lives in bog shoreline habitats around lakes and rivers in northern Wisconsin, and is labeled as a species of Special Concern due to their rarity, leading to a lack of population data.</dd>
                    <hr>
                <dt><b>Northern Leopard Frog</b></dt> <dd><i>Lithobates pipiens</i><br />
                The northern leopard frog is green or light brown with a distinctive pattern of large brown or green spots bordered by yellow.<br />
                It is found in wetlands throughout Wisconsin, and may forage in fields and prairies away from water.</dd>                  
                    <hr>
                <dt><b>Pickerel Frog</b></dt> <dd><i>Lithobates palustris</i><br />
                The pickerel frog is olive green, light brown to tan, or gray frog with dark brown spots resembling stripes running down its back.<br />
                The frog can be found in coldwater streams, seepage pools, and spring holes during the winter, warmer ponds during the breeding season, and spends most of the rest of the year along rivers and streams.<br />
                Scattered throughout parts of southwestern, central, and northern Wisconsin, the species is of Special Concern due to its susceptibility to disease and habitat pollution.
